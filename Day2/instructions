After we completed day1, successfully install needed tools (tekton,Argocd,nexus,..etc)
1. Build a simple pipeline using Tekton to execute
    - clone
    - build code and Image
    - update gitops repo to automate deployment using Argocd using customize task (Task-git-update-deployment.yaml)
2. Create webhooks(EventListener.yaml,TT.yaml,TB.yaml), don't do it manually I recommend using Add Trigger trick through main pipeline from 3 dots.
